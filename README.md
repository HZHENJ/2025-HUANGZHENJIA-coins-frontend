## Backend Service

The backend is built using Dropwizard and provides functionality to calculate the minimum number of coins required based on the target amount and coin denominations.

### Running the Backend Service

#### Locally

1. **Build the backend service**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```
2. **Run the service**:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/proj-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server src/main/resources/config.yml
   ```
3. **Test the endpoints**:
  - Get Start: `http://localhost:8080/api/hello`
  - Main service: `http://localhost:8080/api/minimum-coins`

## Frontend Service

The frontend is built with React.js and provides a simple interface to interact with the backend service.
You can find the frontend source code and setup instructions in the [FrontEnd GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HZHENJ/2025-HUANGZHENJIA-coins-frontend.git).

### Running the Frontend Service

#### Locally

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the service**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Access the application**: The frontend service will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Containerized Deployment

### Running Frontend and Backend Services with Docker Compose

1. **Place the `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root directory**.
2. **Run the following command to start the services**:
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. **Access the services**:
  - Frontend: `http://<your-public-ip>:3000`
  - Backend: `http://<your-public-ip>:8080/api/hello`
